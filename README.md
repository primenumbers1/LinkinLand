# LinkinLand
A Java open source first person shooter (fps), compact, light and completely customizable, with editors. Source code available.No OpenGL, no java3d, the developer has the full knowledge and control of the game rendering, and the player can build and set everything at will. Hope this can stimulate and help other to create their own games following their fantasies and passions.
